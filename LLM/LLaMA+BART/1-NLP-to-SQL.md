# üß† Why Combine LLaMA and BART?

    | Purpose                                | Best Model                                 |
    | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
    | Freeform responses (e.g., chat, story) | ‚úÖ **LLaMA** (decoder-only, generative)     |
    | Structured text generation (e.g., SQL) | ‚úÖ **BART** (encoder-decoder, controllable) |


# üîß How to Combine Them in a System

# üí° Use Case Example:
    => You're building a natural language assistant that can:
    => Answer questions conversationally (LLaMA)
    => Also run SQL queries based on questions (BART)

| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Leverages strengths of both    | Requires two models (larger footprint) |
| Clear modular design           | Needs task routing logic               |
| Flexible for multi-modal tasks | Training and inference costs           |
