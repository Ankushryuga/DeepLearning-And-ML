# üß† How It Works
    =>
    1. Input: Natural language (e.g., "Show all employees in HR")
    2. Tokenizer: Converts input text into tokens
    3. Encoder: Understands the context using bidirectional attention
    4. Decoder: Generates SQL query token by token, attending to encoder outputs
# üõ†Ô∏è Requirements for NLP‚ÜíSQL with BART
    =>
    1. Fine-tuning on a dataset
      - BART must be fine-tuned on a dataset of NL-SQL pairs.
      - Example datasets:
          - Spider: Complex, cross-domain NL-to-SQL pairs
          - WikiSQL: Simpler single-table queries
    2. Schema awareness
      - SQL queries often depend on table schemas. BART needs to "know" the schema (e.g., table and column names).
      - Solutions:
        - Include schema info in the input prompt
        - Preprocess table schema into text form and concatenate with the question



# üß™ Example Prompt
Here‚Äôs what a training or inference input might look like:

Input:
  Tables: employees(name, department, salary)
  Question: Show the names of employees in the HR department.

Output:
  SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
