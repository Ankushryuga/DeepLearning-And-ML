## ML roadmap..
1. Python
2. DSA
3. SQL
4. Mathematics & Statistic & Calculas( Focus on: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Statistics)
5. Data Handling (Python library like "Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, matplotlib")
6. Machine Learning Algorithms.
6.1 Supervised Leanring: Model learn from labeled data.
6.2 Unsupervised Learning: Model learn from unlabeled data.
7. Tool For Machinne learning: TensorFlow, Pytorch, Scikit Learn


## Advanced ML Topics
1. Ensemble Learning: combining multiple models for performance imporvement etc.
2. Deep Learning (Neural network, NLP, Computer vision)



## Model Deployement 
==> python framework like 
1. Flask
2. Django

==> Docker, Kubernetes
