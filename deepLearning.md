## Deep learning is used for unstructured data (don't use deep learning when problem can be solved using simple rule based system)
almost anything can be solved using deep learning as long as you can convert the input data in numbers.
## Deep learning algorithm's
1. Neural networks.
2. Fully connected neural network.
3. Convolutional neural network.
4. Recurrent neural network.
5. Transformer
